# Local Coding Environment Setup

Setting up a local coding environment is essential for developers to work efficiently and consistently across different projects and environments. By using tools like WSL, Vagrant, and Docker, you can create isolated and reproducible development environments tailored to your specific needs.

## What's Included

- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):** Learn how to enable and use WSL to run Linux distributions alongside your Windows system.
- **Vagrant:** Explore Vagrant, a tool for managing virtual machine environments, and understand how to use it to create and provision development environments.
- **Docker:** Discover Docker, a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using containerization technology, and learn how to use it for local development.

## Getting Started

### What is a Virtual Machine?

A virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system that runs on top of a physical hardware system. It allows you to run multiple operating systems and applications on a single physical machine, providing isolation and flexibility.

### What is Vagrant?

Vagrant is an open-source tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. Created by Mitchell Hashimoto and initially released in 2010. It automates the creation and provisioning of VMs, allowing developers to easily replicate development environments across different machines.

### What is Ubuntu?

Ubuntu is a popular Linux distribution based on Debian. It is known for its user-friendly interface, stability, and extensive software ecosystem.

### What Does "Ubuntu" Mean?

"Ubuntu" is an African word meaning "humanity to others" or "I am what I am because of who we all are." It reflects the spirit of community and collaboration that Ubuntu Linux embodies.

### How to Use VMs with Vagrant

To use VMs with Vagrant, you'll need to install Vagrant on your host machine and configure a Vagrantfile to define your VM environment. You can then use Vagrant commands to manage the lifecycle of your VMs, such as creating, starting, stopping, and destroying them.
